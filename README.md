# Android-GmailNavigationDrawer
_An example illustrating how to implement a Navigation Drawer similar to the one in Google's Gmail App in Android_

Google's Gmail App mostly follows the standard navigation drawer you get with the standard material design library. However, there are several  features that sets it apart, including a drop down arrow in the drawer's header. When clicked, another drawer menu is shown. This article will show you how to implement those features.
